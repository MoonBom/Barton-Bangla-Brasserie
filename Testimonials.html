                <p>Booked in for a meal on Sunday night. Whilst looking through the menu the waiter came to take our order. We explained we usually had a Chicken Tikka Masala but were finding it a bid bland nowadays. The waiter spent 10 minutes talking about our tastes and preferences. He than advised two different choices for us both, neither of which we would have chosen ourselves from the menu. The two meals we had were one of the best Indian meals we have ever tasted. Perfect choices! The only downside is we are not back in the area until September. But will be definitely going back. Superb food. </p>

                <p>Absolutely Delicious! Definitely the only Indian Restaurant worth visiting. Not surprised by Best 2021 Award. The food is on another level. Well done Ali and the Team</p>

                <p>We are always greeted with a friendly and warm welcome whether collecting a take away or sitting in. When ordering for takeaways they are polite and usually accurate with collection times. The food quality is excellent both with ingredients and taste. We have never been disappointed as they maintain a high standard. As they have just been re-furbished the decor is more plush which should suit people who want to experience a more special occasion here.</p>

                <p>We visited as a family with two girls with learning disabilities who struggle with communication and the staff here were amazing for them. Listened and was very patient with them whilst ordering. We requested to be sat away from everyone else for it to be quiet for the girls and the staff did exactly that. The food was great and cooked to a excellent quality. Great value for food. Will definitely be back again. Amazing place. </p>

            <div class="card flex">
                <p>Every single dish was flavoured and cooked to perfection. The bhuna was rich, pathos had just a little kick and the paneer shashlick is the best I’ve ever had! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card flex">
                <p>Been numerous times and the food and service is always outstanding. The staff are all incredibly welcoming and make you feel like part of the family. Food as always was exceptional (not surprising from the best Indian restaurant in England 2021). Could not praise these guys enough. A must have of you are close and love a curry. 5 star. </p>
